**run_analysis.R** : performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course project’s definition:
1 -> Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2 -> Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3 -> Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4 -> Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5 -> From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
FinalData.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
